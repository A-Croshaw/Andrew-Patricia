            <p class="ourtext">
                It began with a simple coffee date on the 20th December 2018, They sat and talked for awhile. Patricia sitting there all shy and Andrew been the chatter box through out it all.
                <br>It was a few months on that Patricia then told Andrew she could just about understand half of the conversation they had, down to his English accent, but to shy to ask him to repeat himself, she sat there nodding and smiling pretending she knew what he was on about.<br>
                So for half of it Patricia sat smiling and pretending she knew what Andrew was saying. as she informend 12 months later. <br>
                After spending the next six days on more dates Patricia decides to throw Andrew into the deepend and brought him to meet the family 
                on St. Stephens night, and by god if he didn't run run then she knew he was a keeper!
            </p>
            <p class="ourtext">
                As the weeks turned into months it was then on the 31st January 2020 Andrew decided to take Patricia for a night away, Patricia thought 
                it was just a simple trip away for her birthday.
                <br>Apon arrival at The Lakeside Hotell in Ballina, Killaloe which is sitting on the bank of the River Shannon. 
                Andrew's luck began there with the room being upgrades to there newly built Superior waterfront room. As they entered the room there was a door that led out onto an outside terrace, 
                where you were met with a beautiful and peaceful riverside setting. Thats when he decided this was the right spot to pop the question.
                <br>Just about to head to dinner Andrew called Patricia out onto the terrace. Andrew started get extreamley nervous as he was about to propose. he held Patricia very 
                tightly into him, one hand wrapped around her and the other tightly in his pocket holding the ring.
                <br>Starting to freeze he eventually managed to get the words together to ask her to marry him with forgetting to actually go down on 
                one knee! Patricia still said YES!. <br> Too this day Patricia still jokes about Andrew not going down on one knee!!
            </p>
            <p class="ourtext">
                This is it the day has come where Patricia & Andrew are tieing the knot.
            </p>
            <p class="ourtext">
                We're so excited for you to join and celebrate this special day with us <br> x
